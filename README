This is a small interface that allows OpenCL access from OpenStack.

I tested the programs on a devstack install. The intalation folder for my configuration 
was $NOVA_DIR = /opt/stack

The interface consists of the following parts

ComputeNode:
- server side python programs
    reside in $NOVA_DIR/nova/contrib/OpenCLServer
- a shared library PyOpenCLInterface.so that exposes OpenCL to python calls.
    
Controller Node
- nova compute api-extesion
    - WSGI extension - reside in $NOVA_DIR/nova/nova/api/openstack/compute/contrib
      unit tests are in $NOVA_DIR.nova/nova/tests/api/openstack/compute/contrib
         these are not integrated yet into openstack tests but they are written 
         using pyton unittest module. The user should run the tests to ensure that
         the openCL interface is up.
    - internal OpenCL API client - reside in $NOVA_DIR/nova/nova/OpenCL
      unit tests in $NOVA_DIR/nova/nova/tests/OpenCL
         these are not integrated yet into openstack tests but they are written 
         using pyton unittest module. The user should run the tests to ensure that
         the openCL interface is up.
- python client
    python sources are in $NOVA_DIR/novaclient/v1_1/contrib
    small test programs $NOVA_DIR/novaclient/tests/v1_1/contrib

Instalation:
Step 1: Build the PyOpenCLInterface.so library;
 - go to folder ServerSidePythonOpenCLInterface
 - Set the include and lib folders to match your system in file OpenCLInterfaceSetup.py.
 - Build the shared library.

  $python OpenCLInterfaceSetup.py build

  This should create PyOpenCLInterface.so in a subfolder 'build'. 
 - Copy the shared library PyOpenCLInterface.so into the tests/ subfolder. 
  Goto subfolder tests to run the unit tests for PyOpenCLInterface.
  $cd tests
  - Build the PyTestObjects.so shared lib.
  $python TestObjectsSetup.py build
  - Copy the shared library PyTestObjects into the tests folder. 
  - Run the unit tests to ensure that the OpenCL is running properly.

Step 2: Install the Compute node components
 - Copy PyOpenCLInterface.so to $NOVA_DIR/nova/contrib/OpenCLServer
 - Copy OpenCLServer.py to $NOVA_DIR/nova/contrib/OpenCLServer
 - Copy queues.py from nova/nova/OpenCL to $NOVA_DIR/nova/OpenCL
 - change the address of the amqp connection to match your configuration. This is in the __main__ 
   of script OpenCLServer.py
Step3: Install the controller components
  Copy the python files for the resource extensions and unit tests into the nova directory structure.
  Folders:
  nova/nova/api/openstack/compute/contrib
  nova/nova/OpenCL
  nova/nova/tests/OpenCL
  nova/nova/tests/api/openstack/compute/contrib
  change the source and target messaging configuration for the rpc connection in 
  $NOVA_DIR/nova/nova/OpenCL/OpenCLRPCAPI.py file (class OpenCLRPCAPI.__init__(...)). 
Step 3: Copy the client python files into the novaclient folder.
Step 4: Run the server on the compute node
  python OpenCLServer.py
Step 5: Run the opencl unit tests in folders
  /nova/nova/tests/OpenCL/
  /nova/nova/tests/api/openstack/compute/contrib/

Step 4: Change the settings in TestcomputeOpenCL/credentials.py to match your configuration.
Step 5: Run the samples in TestcomputeOpenCL.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- the OpenCLServer has to be manually started
